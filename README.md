### Welcome ðŸ‘‹  

I am a Senior DevOps / Cloud Engineer with a strong preference for developing and using infrastructure as code principles.
I specialize in building cloud solutions in Azure using both declarative and imperative approaches.

My current focus is on development and the integration of AI-assisted tools into DevOps processes â€” improving efficiency, validation, and automation through intelligent systems.

With a background in operations as a sysadmin, I bring both stability and innovation to the table.

I enjoy blogging and writing about the challenges and solutions I encounter along the way.

Some keywords to describe my personality: eager to learn, thinker, ambitious, impatient, accurate,
strong feeling of responsibility.

terraform, bicep, pulumi, CI/CD, powershell, docker, kubernetes, go, python, lua, rust, ai, machine learning
